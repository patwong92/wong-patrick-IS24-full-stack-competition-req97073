-   Install Docker if you have not done so.
-   To confirm if you have docker installed in your terminal, run docker
    -   You should be able to see the list of options and commands
-   Make sure Docker is on. One way to check this is to open Docker Desktop
    -   On the directory that contains the docker-compose.yml file, run docker-compose build --pull
-   This will build the images for the server and the client
-   Run docker-compose up -d to start the application
-   To stop the application, run docker-compose stop
-   If you want to stop and remove the client and server containers, run docker-compose down
